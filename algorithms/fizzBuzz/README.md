# FizzBuzz

The `fizzBuzz` function should take one param, `x` which is the upper bound number.

FizzBuzz should return a string of every number from 1 to `x` separated by a space.

If the number is divisible by `3` instead of logging the number you should log `fizz`

If the number is divisible by `5` log `buzz`

If the number is divisible by `3` and `5` log `fizzbuzz`
