# Roman Numeral Converter

Write a roman numeral converter that converts roman numerals to numbers ([Arabic numeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals)) and vice versa. The input can be any number from 1 - 1000.

The converter has two functions. The first `toNumber` should take a roman numeral number as a string and return it as a number.
The second function `toRomanNumeral` should take a number and return the same value as a roman numeral.
