### Insertion Sort

Compare the value at index `1` to the value in index `0`. If `arr[0] > arr[1]` remove the value at index `1` and insert it into index `0`. Also move the value at index `0` into index `1`. Next move to the value at index `2` and compare it to the value in index `1` making the same comparison until you reach the index `0` again. Continue doing this comparison the entire length of the array. This algorithm run in `O(nÂ²)`
