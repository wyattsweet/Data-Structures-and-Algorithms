### Bubble Sort

This is the least complex sorting algorithm to implement but the time complexity is also the worst.

**steps**

1. Imagine a function that takes a unsorted array of numbers
* first look at the first two elements in the array (`a` and `b`)
* if `a` is less than `b`, swap them
* next compare `b` and `c` and swap them if `b` is greater than `c`
* continue this process through the entire length of the array
* start comparing from the beginning of the array again
* repeat until the entire array is sorted
