# Breadth-First Search

The breadth-first search algorithm starts traversing the graph at the specified vertex and visits each of it's adjacent nodes one layer at a time. It in called breadth-first search because it visits the nodes first widely and then deeply. In BFS, vertices are often stored in a queue. The oldest unexplored vertices are visited first.
