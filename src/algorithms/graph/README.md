# Graph Algorithms

Traversals are used to visit each node on a graph. There are two algorithms that can be used to traverse a graph, **Breath-first search** and **Depth-first search**. With these traversal algorithms we must keep keep of each vertex when we first visit it and keep track of which vertices have not been completely explored. To completely explore a vertex, we must look at each edge of the vertex. For both graph traversal algorithms you can start on any vertex and will need to specify what vertex to start on up front.
