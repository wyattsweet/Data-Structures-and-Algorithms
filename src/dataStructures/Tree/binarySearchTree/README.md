# Binary Search Tree

## Algorithms

### in-order traversal

A In order traversal of a binary search tree will visit each node in order from smallest to largest. The traversal will start at the left most node and visit each node until it reaches the right most node.

### pre-order traversal

pre-order traversal visits the current node prior to its descendants. In pre-order traversal you visit the root node first, then the left, then the right.

### post-order traversal

The current node is visited after its descendants have been visited.
